# üéÆ Jocasta Protocol - Marvel Rivals Game Assistant

Hey everyone,

üåü I'm Starliedge, and I'm excited to share some details about my project, ***JocastaProtocol***, a game assistant for Marvel Rivals. Jocasta and I teamed up on this, merging our skills in projectile homing and aim assist. We named it after that awesome Marvel robot because that's precisely what it does - assists players.

This tool is completely free, and we've got a Discord community going to keep the conversation alive. While it's been undetectable, it's important to practice caution. Manual bans can happen if you're too obvious.

üéØ Here's a breakdown of the core features:

## Aimbot System

My aim assist system is designed to improve your accuracy in Marvel Rivals:

-   ***Smart Target Selection***: Automatically identifies and locks onto enemy players.
-   ***Smooth Aiming***: Natural-looking aim movement.
-   ***Adaptive Movements***: Learns and adapts to your aiming patterns.
-   ***First Enemy Lock***: Option to lock onto the first enemy detected.
-   ***Target Invisible Enemies***: Ability to target enemies that are invisible.
-   ***Flying Target Priority***: Prioritizes airborne enemies.
-   ***Team Target Mode***: Configurable team targeting options.
-   ***Role-Based Targeting***: Can prioritize specific hero roles.

## Projectile Redirection

Think of this as advanced projectile manipulation. It enhances your shooting effectiveness:

-   ***Natural Movement Patterns***: Mimics human aiming behavior.

## Flick System

For those quick, autonomous aiming moments:

-   ***Instant Response***: Temporarily reduces smoothing.
-   ***Configurable Duration***: Adjustable time period for activation.
-   ***Multiple Reduction Types***: Linear, exponential, or quadratic reduction curves.
-   Independent Operation: Works autonomously without interfering with other systems.
